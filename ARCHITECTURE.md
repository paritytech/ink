# ink!ternals

This document describes the architecture of ink!. The information
here targets those who want to understand or modify the inner
workings of this project.

In general we treat documentation as a first-class citizen.
All crates mentioned below should be documented really well.
You can find the crate documentation on docs.rs or for our
`master` branch under GitHub pages. So for `ink_lang` e.g.:

* [https://docs.rs/ink_lang/latest/ink_lang](https://docs.rs/ink_lang/latest/ink_lang) (latest)
* [https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_lang](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_lang) (`master`)

ink! is composed of a number of crates that are all found in the
`crates/` folder. On a high-level those can be grouped as:

* `lang`: The ink! language itself.
* `allocator`: The allocator used for dynamic memory allocation in a contract.
* `engine`: An off-chain testing engine, it simulates a blockchain
   environment and allows mocking specified conditions.
* `env`: Exposes environmental functions, like information about the caller
   of a contract call, getting random entropy, or e.g. self-terminating the
	 contract.
* `metadata`: Describes how to call a contract (it's interface and the
   types), its storage layout, etc..
* `prelude`: Provides an interface to typical standard library types and
  functionality (like `vec` or `string`). Since contracts are run in a
	`no_std` environment we provide this crate as an entrypoint for accessing
	functionality of the standard library.
* `primitives`: Utilities that are used internally by multiple ink! crates.
* `storage`: The collections that are available for contract developers
  to put in a smart contracts storage.

An important thing to note is that the crates are primarily run in
a `no_std` environment, specifically in a Wasm sandbox execution
environment on the blockchain itself.
Exceptions are `metadata` and `engine`, which cover use-cases that
are only relevant off-chain.

## Overview

<img src="./.images/inkternals.png" alt="ink!ternals" width="800" />

The above diagram shows the main components of ink! and how they
interact. This pipeline is run once you execute `cargo build`
on an ink! smart contract.

The central delegating crate is `ink_lang`. 

In the `crates/lang/` folder you'll find three separate
crates on which `ink_lang` relies heavily:

* `ink_lang_macro`: The procedural macros, they take code annotated with e.g.
   `[ink::contract]` and forwards it to `ink_lang_ir`.
* `ink_lang_ir`: Defines everything the procedural macro needs in order to
   parse, analyze and generate code for ink! smart contracts.
* `ink_lang_codegen`: Generates Rust code from the ink! IR.

## Code Generation

We avoid structuring things via hidden or private modules, this
was the ink! v1 way of doing code generation and it was bug prone
and hard to maintain. 

What we do instead to generate code that is hidden from users is to
pack it into anonymous `const` (so `const _: () = { â€¦ };`) and connect
it to the outside world with private trait implementations. You can
see how this looks by installing [`cargo-expand`](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand)
and executing `cd examples/flipper/ && cargo expand` in this repository.

## Allocator

ink! smart contracts use a very simple bump allocator for dynamic
allocations. You can find it in `crates/allocator/`.

This allocator never frees allocated space, in case it runs out of
a defined limit of space to allocate it crashes.
This was done with the intention of reducing its complexity, which
would have resulted in higher costs for the user (due to increased
gas costs) and a lower transaction throughput. Freeing memory is
irrelevant for our use-case anyway, as the entire memory instance
is set up fresh for each individual contract call anyway.

## Nightly features in ink!

We would like to get away from nightly features in ink!, so that users
can just use stable. At the moment we're still stuck with two nightly
features though:

* [core_intrinsics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/intrinsics/index.html)
* [alloc_error_handler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51540)

Both are needed for the `ink_allocator` crate.
